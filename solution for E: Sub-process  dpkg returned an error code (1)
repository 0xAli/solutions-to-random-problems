So i was hacking my way to install a package and it broke my pkg, i got the error:
"Processing triggers for XXXX ...
Errors were encountered while processing:
 troubled-pkg
E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)"

solution is by running:
dpkg --remove --force-all troubled-pkg


Where troubled-pkg is the package that caused the problem
