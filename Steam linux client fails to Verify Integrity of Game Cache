Known issue https://github.com/0xAli/solutions-to-random-problems/new/master

Solution: Create a new library
Settings -> Download -> Steam library folders
And create a new folder
Then copy your /home/$(whoami)/.local/share/Steam/SteamApps directory contents into the newly created SteamApps
And you can then delete the contents of the old folder.

And when you are installing a new game, steam will prompt to ask you where you wanna install it, choose the new one
