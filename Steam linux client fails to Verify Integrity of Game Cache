Known issue https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-for-linux/issues/2515

It's because your distro is encrypting /home and thus steam can't recognize it well..

Solution: Create a new library
Settings -> Download -> Steam library folders
And create a new folder
Then copy your /home/$(whoami)/.local/share/Steam/SteamApps directory contents into the newly created SteamApps
And you can then delete the contents of the old folder.

And when you are installing a new game, steam will prompt to ask you where you wanna install it, choose the new one
