Hello, world!

Linux Mint (After i broke it) wouldn't ask for password and wouldn't install new packages for the update.

I couldn't (READ: wouldn't bother) fix it or know the exact error.

But here is a workaround that makes it update (Despite not asking for password)

sudo nano /usr/share/polkit-1/actions/com.ubuntu.pkexec.synaptic.policy 

edit the line <allow_active>auth_admin</allow_active> to
 <allow_active>yes</allow_active>

  .... save and quit
  Ctrl o
  Ctrl x

I found that the file resets itself, so I write-protected the file and now it works on me.

sudo chattr +i /usr/share/polkit-1/actions/com.ubuntu.pkexec.synaptic.policy
