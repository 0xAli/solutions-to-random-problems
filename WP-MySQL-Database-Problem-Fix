Sometimes wordpress load just kills the MySQL instance and gives you the infamous "Error establishing a database connection" error.

So here is a workaround to fix it http://askubuntu.com/a/451889


***************** Copy of solution ****************
#!/bin/bash
if [[ ! "$(service mysql status)" =~ "start/running" ]]
then
    service mysql start
fi

Be sure that is executable:

chmod +x /path/to/script

Then add a new entry in the root crontab as follow:

    Edit root crontab file using:

    sudo crontab -e

    And add the following line to the file:

    */1 * * * * /path/to/script
