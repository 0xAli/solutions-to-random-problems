Fresh new install and the newly created homepage

ExecJS::ProgramError in Home#main

Showing C:/Sites/X/app/views/layouts/application.html.erb where line #6 raised:

TypeError: Object doesn't support this property or method
  (in C:/Sites/X/app/assets/javascripts/home.js.coffee)

Solution is to change application to default in application.html.erb
